# gallereasy

Hi guys, welcome to my private repository for the technical qualification test

In my work:
- I used both stateless component and React.Component for better demonstration of usage.
- I install every piece of required libraries instead of using `create-react-app`.
- Bootstrap is cool but I know how to survive without it.
- Deployment using Now.sh with built-in CI/CD fully integrated with this github repository.
- ...etc

Deployment for preview running at: https://gallereasy.now.sh/

Let me know if there is anything which I can make some improvals for by opening issues or reach me by my skype: leanhducvt@live.com

Thank you.
